1.Data Set Summary & Exploration
training data / test data is provided. the result of data summary as below:

	"Number of training examples = 34799 # size of training data
	Number of testing examples = 12630 # size of test data
	Image data shape = (32, 32, 3) # shape of data 
	Number of classes = 43 # labels number in training data"

 the code is on "Provide a Basic Summary of the Data Set Using Python, Numpy and/or Pandas" part

2.Provide a Basic Summary of the Data Set Using Python, Numpy and/or Pandas
a. since the data is already 32*32 format,  the preprocess only do shuffle for training and test data set
b. i split shuffled training images set with batch_size = 128 which is the same for validation and test set.the code is on 9th part cell
 	I pass images into model one batch by one batch contiuously. 
 	the final test image is from GTSRB data set. the final test image is not always 32*32 shapen and ppm format. 
 	I need load them by skimage lib, and resize them to 32*32 by numpy. the code is on 11th part cell.
c.  based on what i learned, i use lenet architechture to build my CNN model. since this project is just for classification without
 	location identification, and test image size is also quite small, so lenet should be good enough
 	
 	[	Layer				Description  ]
 		Input				32x32x3 RGB image
		Convolution 		5x5	1x1 stride, valid padding, outputs 28*28*6
		RELU				YES
		Max pooling			2x2 stride, outputs 14x14x6
		Convolution_2		5x5	1x1 stride, valid padding, outputs 10*10*16
		RELU				YES
		Max pooling			2x2 stride, outputs 5x5x16
		Fully connected		mean = 0, sigma = 0.1, input 400, output 120
		Fully connected 	mean = 0, sigma = 0.1, input 120, output 84
		Fully connected 	mean = 0, sigma = 0.1, input 84,  output 10
		Softmax				output = 10
	
	Optimizer = AdamOptimizer, Learning rate = 4*1e-4
	Batch_Size = 128
	Epoch = 100
d.	training set accuracy = unrecorded
	validation set accuracy = 0.899
	test set accuracy = 0.887

3. final test images is from GTSRB data set in which images format is ppm, and the size is not 32 * 32.
   before I start test, i need load ppm file by skimage and resize them to 32*32 by numpy
   I pass 5 images to model, the result:
